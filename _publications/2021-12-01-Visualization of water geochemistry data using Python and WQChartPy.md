Graphical methods have been widely used for visualization, classification, and interpretation of water geochemical data to obtain a better understanding of surface and subsurface hydrologic systems. This method note presents WQChartPy, an open-source Python package for producing a total of eleven diagrams for visualizing water geochemistry data that are organized in the comma-separated values (CSV) format. The eleven diagrams include eight traditional diagrams (Piper trilinear, Durov, Chadha, Stiff, Chernoff face, Schoeller, Gibbs, and Gaillardet) and three recently proposed diagrams (rectangle Piper, color-coded Piper, and HFE-D) that have not been implemented in existing graphing software. Figures generated by WQChartPy can be saved as portable network graphics (PNG), scalable vector graphics (SVG), or portable document format (PDF) files. A self-contained Jupyter Notebook file is included in this package to illustrate how to use WQChartPy by using an example dataset. WQChartPy is easy to use, and the graphical diagrams can be generated by writing several lines of Python codes. The source codes of WQChartPy are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/jyangfsu/WQChartPy) and PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/wqchartpy/).
