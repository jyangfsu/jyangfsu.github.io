When a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, a Lagrangian and meshfree numerical scheme, is used to solve the advection-dispersion equation (ADE), SPH solutions may not be accurate when particles are irregularly distributed, i.e., the distance between two neighbor particles varies irregularly in a simulation domain. Particle irregularity may be caused by nonuniform groundwater flow in a heterogeneous field of hydraulic conductivity. This study explores for the first time whether the Finite Particle Method (FPM) can provide more accurate ADE solutions than SPH does for irregularly distributed particles. FPM is similar to SPH in theory, but uses a modified kernel gradient to construct a SPH approximation of solute concentration gradients. Performance of SPH and FPM with irregularly distributed particles is evaluated by using two numerical cases. The first case considers only diffusive transport, and has an analytical solution for the evaluation. The second case considers both advection and dispersion, and uses a numerical solution as a reference for the evaluation. For each of the two cases, several numerical experiments are conducted using multiple sets of irregularly distributed particles with different levels of particle irregularity due to different levels of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity. Numerical results indicate that, for the numerical experiments of this study, FPM outperforms SPH to yield more accurate ADE solutions. However, FPM solutions are still subject to numerical errors, and the errors increase when the level of heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity increases. Further improvement of FPM is warranted in a future study.
