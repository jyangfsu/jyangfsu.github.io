The elective course "Hydrological Models and Intelligent Forecasting" is designed for students specializing in Intelligent Water Conservancy and Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering. This course serves to provide a comprehensive overview of key topics in hydrological forecasting, including the foundational theories, classifications, and characteristics of watershed hydrological models. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the Xin'anjiang and SWAT models, widely recognized within the field. Additionally, the curriculum covers real-time flood forecasting, dry-season runoff prediction, machine learning methodologies for time series forecasting, and intelligent forecasting techniques integrating big data analytics and deep learning methodologies. Upon completion of this course, students are expected to demonstrate a proficient understanding of both lumped and distributed watershed hydrological models, alongside a familiarity with their practical applications. Furthermore, students will have acquired a mastery of the fundamental principles, methodologies, and modeling techniques essential for hydrological forecasting. Armed with this knowledge, students will be equipped to utilize hydrological models and machine learning methods effectively for the purposes of forecasting. Ultimately, this course aims to establish a robust foundation for students, enabling them to engage confidently in the planning, construction, and management of water projects, as well as initiatives pertaining to flood control and drought management.
