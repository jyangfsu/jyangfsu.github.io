Hi! I’m Jing, a doctoral  student at the School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences. My major is Hydraulic Engineering by training with a background in  Hydrogeology, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble.  I study physical surface water-groundwater interactions and hope to branch out into the biogeochemical side of hydro(geo)logy. 

My work and research
======
Most of my previous work has focused on using statistical tools for understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry and its controlling factors. I’ve also studied uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis in hydrological modeling. I study topics including numerical simulation of flow and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated porous and fractured media; uncertainty assessment of hydrologic parameters, conceptual models, and scenarios; risk analysis and decision-making under uncertainty;
geostatistical methods for site characterization and contaminant remediation; and stochastic methods in groundwater hydrology. I also often focus on high performance computing using state-of-the-art algorithms and tools.

Ph.D. Dissertation: Methods and applications of multi-model global sensitivity analysis for identifying controlling processes in subsurface hydrological modeling 

My background and history
======
I received my B.S. from Yangtze University in 2013, and then entered into China University of Geosciences to pursue my doctoral degree. I joined the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University in February 2018 as a Visiting Scholar working with Dr. Ming Ye. For just under six months after my visiting, I returned to CUG, and then joined the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University in March 2019 as a Laboratory Assistant.
