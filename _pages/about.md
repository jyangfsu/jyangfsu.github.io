# 👋 Hi, I’m Jing  

I am an **Associate Professor** at the **School of Land Engineering, Chang’an University**.  

I earned my Ph.D. from the [School of Environmental Studies](https://ses.cug.edu.cn/) at [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cug.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhonghua Tang](https://ses.cug.edu.cn/info/1124/1787.htm).  

My training is in **Hydraulic Engineering** with a strong background in **Hydrogeology**. Along the way, I picked up just enough **computer science and data science** to make trouble.  

My current research focuses on **groundwater flow and solute transport modeling**, and I’m expanding into the **biogeochemical side of hydro(geo)logy**.

## 💡 Research Interests  

My work integrates hydrology, hydrogeology, and computational methods. Some of my core areas include:  

- 🌊 **Groundwater and solute transport modeling** in saturated and unsaturated porous media  
- 📊 **Statistical and geostatistical approaches** for understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry  
- 🔍 **Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis** of hydrologic parameters, conceptual models, and future scenarios  
- ⚖️ **Risk analysis and decision-making under uncertainty**  
- 🧪 **Contaminant remediation strategies** using site characterization and stochastic methods  
- ⚡ **High-performance computing** and advanced algorithms for large-scale hydrological simulations
