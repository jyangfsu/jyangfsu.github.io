Hi! I’m Jing, an Associate Professor at the School of Land Engineering, Chang’an University.

I earned my Ph.D. from the [School of Environmental Studies](https://ses.cug.edu.cn/) at [China University of Geosciences](https://www.cug.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhonghua Tang](https://ses.cug.edu.cn/info/1124/1787.htm). My major is Hydraulic Engineering by training with a background in  Hydrogeology, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble.  I study groundwater flow and solute transport modleing and hope to branch out into the biogeochemical side of hydro(geo)logy. 

My work and research
======
My work integrates hydrology, hydrogeology, and computational methods. Some of my core areas include:
*Groundwater and solute transport modeling in saturated and unsaturated porous media
*Statistical and geostatistical approaches for understanding spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry
*Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of hydrologic parameters, conceptual models, and future scenarios
*Risk analysis and decision-making under uncertainty
*Contaminant remediation strategies using site characterization and stochastic methods
*High-performance computing and advanced algorithms for large-scale hydrological simulations

My background and history
======
I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Yangtze University](http://yangtzeu.edu.cn/) at June 2013, and then entered into China University of Geosciences to pursue my doctoral degree. I joined [The Department of Scientific Computing](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/) at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/) at February 2018 as a Visiting Scholar, working with [Prof. Ming Ye](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~mye/). For just under six months after my visiting, I returned to CUG, and then joined [The Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/) at Florida State University at March 2019 as a Laboratory Assistant. I came back to CUG at November 2020 and got my doctoral degree at December 2021. Following my Ph.D., I joined the College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, Northwest A&F University in June 2022, and in July 2025 I became an Associate Professor at the School of Land Engineering, Chang’an University.
